GetNinjasInternshipTest is an Android app developed as a test for an Anroid developer internship position at GetNinjas.


What does this app do?
-------------
The app has a list of job `offers`, which a pro can accept or reject.

When an `offer` is accepted, it becomes a `lead`. The main difference between a `lead` and an `offer` is that a `lead` has customer contacts, and `offer` does not.

The app counts with:
> - Offer and Leads lists;
> - Details Page;
> - Rest API implementation;
> - Google Maps Integration;
> - Intents to external apps (Dial and WhatsApp)
> - Swipe to Update.

App's Goal
-------------
To get the internship position  * *crossed fingers* *
